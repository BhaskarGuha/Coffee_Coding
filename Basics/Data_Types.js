    There are seven types in JavaScript:
    1. Number: It is used to represent numeric values.
    2. String: It is used to represent textual data.
    3. Boolean: It is used to represent true or false values.
    4. Undefined: It is used to represent an undefined value.Its 
    5. Null: It is used to represent a null value.
    6. Object: It is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs.Its non-primitive data type.It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
    7. Symbol: It is used to represent a unique value.

//Refernece Data Types in JavaScript are: Object, Array, Function.
// Example of an Object
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true
};
console.log(person); // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30, isEmployed: true }

// Example of an Array
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

// Example of a Function
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}//function can also be assigned to a variable. let myFunction = function() { console.log("Hello!"); };
console.log(greet("Alice")); // "Hello, Alice!"

console.log(typeof fruits) // non-primitive data types are of type object. Function is also of type object.
//typeof normally returns "object" for all non-primitive types.
//Only functions return "function", even though they are technically objects.
//This behavior exists to make it easier to detect functions in JavaScript.
